A Python application for managing screenshot notes. This tool allows you to capture screenshots and add annotations, making it perfect for documentation, tutorials, and note-taking.

## Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# OR
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:
```bash
python "Run Me.py"
```

## Development

- The main script is `Run Me.py`
- Dependencies are managed in `requirements.txt`
- Remember to activate the virtual environment before running the script
